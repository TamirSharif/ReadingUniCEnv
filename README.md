# ReadingUniCEnv
Bash script for setting up a C/C++ environment

Copy paste each line individually
(you can auto completle a file/folder name by cicking tab, but this won't work for the url)

```
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/TamirSharif/ReadingUniCEnv.git
cd ReadingUniCEnv
sudo chmod 777 install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

Then just wait a bit, and reconsider your life decisions
